# collab_test

This repo is intent for testing a workflow for collaboration. The idea is to test how to work on the same script at the same time using github. 

## the repo

I asked chatGPT for a piece of code, which we can use to review and test the github functionalities and the collaboration workflow. 

I asked: 

"*create a script, with a simulation.   
create a gradient between diversity and temperature.   
Model the relationship using temperature, precipitation and aridity.   
Plot the relationship.   
Compare the results with using only the temperature as covariate*"

The first state of the script is as chatGPT provided.

## `main` branch

The `main` branch is block for push. 

All code changes should be done in a separated branch and merged to main by pull request.
